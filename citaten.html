<p>They hang the man and flog the woman<br />
That steal the goose from off the common,<br />
But let the greater villain loose<br />
That steals the common from the goose.</p>

<p>The law demands that we atone<br />
When we take things we do not own<br />
But leaves the lords and ladies fine<br />
Who take things that are yours and mine.</p>

<p>The poor and wretched don't escape<br />
If they conspire the law to break;<br />
This must be so but they endure<br />
Those who conspire to make the law.</p>

<p>The law locks up the man or woman<br />
Who steals the goose from off the common'<br />
And geese will still a common lack<br />
Till they go and steal it back.</p>

<p>Engels volksdicht, ca. 1764</p>
