UDS Boston: centralising locoteam administration

• what administration would we like help from Canonical for?
∘ support points map
∘ cms editor authentication
∘ planet
∘ events
∘ (in the longer term) forum authentication (?)
• why would we love Canonical to help?
• unify underlying data sets:
∘ geographical & linguistical overlap
• center on the individual ("l'important, c'est le visage")
∘ do I feel like a member of the Dutch language community? of the Dutch geographical community?
‣ is the team handling my private date with due respect?
• information property with recognised local community teams:
∘ enable a set of extra launchpad profile fields for members
• what's in it for canonical?
∘ data mining (no personally identifiable information!)
∘ more email addresses
∘ more personal information from those who agree to share this with Canonical (not the default!)
∘ measure local community performance better
∘ more local community output
‣ existing groups: increased efficiency & quality
‣ beginning groups: easier first steps
∘ less potential for policital tension (Kurdish, Taiwan,...)
∘ increased shipit efficiency?
‣ "if I request a shipit shipment, you can use this postal address"
• what's in it for locoteams?
∘ measure performance
∘ administrative ease
∘ easier and more resource sharing with other locoteams
∘ less dependency on technical volunteers:
‣ opening up to a less technical public becomes easier
‣ technical continuity
‣ reliability of locoteam services
• local team leader
• why not just put everything in launchpad and be done with it?
∘ launchpad is a black box; that in itself is fine, as long as you can get your stuff out of it
∘ a significant part of the community trust faces, distrust an isle of Mann company
∘ local community teams have a certain autonomy
